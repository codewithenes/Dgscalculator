# Dgscalculator


DGS (Vertical Transfer Exam) is a significant test in Turkey. While preparing for it, I frequently used various DGS calculating websitesâ€”often more than twice a day. I noticed a recurring issue: these websites often provided inconsistent results when I calculated my marks.

To address this problem, I decided to develop an app that delivers accurate marks, unlike the other websites. I hope it proves to be reliable for you.
